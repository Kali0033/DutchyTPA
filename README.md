# GrimurOTT (DutchyTPA)
Minecraft 1.16, 1.17

Based on a very, very simple TPA plugin by TheDutchMC. Implements a new mechanic by where players can TPA request another player provided they have not done so before or 24 hours has not expired from their initial join. Plugin records down UUID and status in config.yml.

## Commands
- ``/ott <playername>``: One Time Teleport to a player
- ``/ottaccept``, ``/ottyes``: Accept an OTT request
- ``/ottdeny``, ``/ottno``: Deny an OTT request

Much props to TheDutchMC for his simple but flawless plugin DutchyTPA.
